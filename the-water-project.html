									<br>
								</p>
								<p>St. Elizabeth Shipala Primary School in Kenya now has access to a new source of safe,
								   clean water thanks to the completion of their rain tank! We installed new latrines
								   and handwashing stations for students, and we trained the school on improved
								   sanitation and hygiene practices, including COVID-19 prevention. These components
								   will unlock the opportunity for these students to live better, healthier lives.</p>
								<p><img class="img-responsive alignnone wp-image-139887 size-full"
								        src="https://res.cloudinary.com/the-water-project/image/upload/c_fill,dpr_auto,q_auto,f_auto,w_1200/WP-Uploads/community/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kenya21254-0-clean-hands.jpg"

									"I will have peace of mind because there will be no interference between lessons
									where we were taken out of class to go and bring water," said 14-year-old student,
									Patricia N. "That being the case, I will have enough time in class to do revision
									(to study), and this will lead to improvement in my academic performance."</p>
								<p>Teachers were just as excited as the students about the new rain tank on campus.</p>
								<p>"Everything has been made easy for both teachers and pupils," said Head Teacher Mark
								   Shitikha.</p>
								<p></p>

								<p>"Initially, a lot of time was wasted getting water from the borehole. But with water
								   in our school compound, there will be a great improvement in our academic
								   performance. With water within our reach, [the] sanitation standards of our school
								   will improve."</p>
								<h3><strong>How We Go From Ground to Rain Tank</strong></h3>
								<p>Construction for this 75,000-liter rain tank was successful!</p>
								<p>Parents, staff, and students helped our artisans gather everything needed for
								   construction.</p>
								<p></p>
								<div id="attachment_139891" style="max-width: 5162px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img
										class="img-responsive wp-image-139891 size-full"
										src="https://res.cloudinary.com/the-water-project/image/upload/c_fill,dpr_auto,q_auto,f_auto,w_1200/WP-Uploads/community/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kenya21254-1-bringing-bricks.jpg"
										alt="">
									<p class="wp-caption-text">Girls bringing bricks.</p></div>
								<p></p>
								<p>The school's kitchen staff and a few parents helped provide meals for the artisans,
								   while the school provided the artisans' accommodations. Locals helped our artisans
								   with their manual labor, too.</p>
								<p>The process officially began with our staff and school administration looking around
								   the school compound to determine the best location for a new rain tank. This needed
								   to be the best site with enough land and a nearby building with good, clean roofing
								   to catch the rainwater.</p>
								<p>Then, we cleared the site by excavating the soil to make level ground for the tank
								   foundation.</p>
								<p><img class="img-responsive alignnone wp-image-139892 size-full"
								        src="https://res.cloudinary.com/the-water-project/image/upload/c_fill,dpr_auto,q_auto,f_auto,w_1200/WP-Uploads/community/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kenya21254-2.1-excavation.jpg"
								        alt=""></p>
								<p>We cast the foundation by laying big stones on the level ground and reinforcing them
								   using steel wire, concrete, and waterproof cement. We affixed both the drawing pipe
								   and the drainage pipe as we laid the foundation.</p>
								<p>Next, we formed the walls using a skeleton of rebar and wire mesh with sugar sacks
								   temporarily tied to the outside as backing.</p>
								<p><img class="img-responsive alignnone wp-image-139904 size-full"
								        src="https://res.cloudinary.com/the-water-project/image/upload/c_fill,dpr_auto,q_auto,f_auto,w_1200/WP-Uploads/community/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kenya21254-2.2-sugar-sacks-on-frame.jpg"
								        alt=""></p>
								<p>We attached this to the foundation's edges so that the work team could start the
								   Ferro-cementing process. They began layering the walls with cement, alternating with
								   the inner and outer side until six cement layers were in place. (The sugar sacks are
								   removed once the interior receives its first two layers of cement.)</p>
								<p>Inside the tank, we cast one central and four support pillars to ensure the dome does
								   not cave in once cemented.</p>
								<p><img class="img-responsive alignnone wp-image-139899 size-full"
								        src="https://res.cloudinary.com/the-water-project/image/upload/c_fill,dpr_auto,q_auto,f_auto,w_1200/WP-Uploads/community/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kenya21254-2.2-pillar-setting-1.jpg"
								        alt=""></p>
								<p>Meanwhile, we plastered the inner wall while roughcasting the outer walls. We dug and
								   plastered the access area to the tap outside the tank, installing a short staircase.
								   In front of the access area, we constructed a soak pit where spilled water can drain
								   from the access area through the ground. The pit helps to keep the tap area dry and
								   tidy.</p>
								<p><img class="img-responsive alignnone wp-image-139907 size-full"
								        src="https://res.cloudinary.com/the-water-project/image/upload/c_fill,dpr_auto,q_auto,f_auto,w_1200/WP-Uploads/community/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kenya21254-2.3-drawing-point-construction.jpg"
								        alt=""></p>
								<p>Dome construction could begin after the tank walls settled. We attached a dome
								   skeleton of rebar, wire mesh, and sugar sacks to the tank walls before cementing and
								   plastering it using similar techniques as the wall construction. We included a small
								   manhole cover into the dome to allow access for future cleanings and water
								   treatments.</p>
								<p>We propped long wooden poles (about 75 of them!) inside the tank to support the dome
								   while it cured. Then it was down to the finishing touches: fitting a lockable cover
								   over the tap area, affixing the gutters to the roof and tank, and setting an overflow
								   pipe in place at the edge of the dome for when the tank reaches capacity.</p>
								<p>Once finished, we gave the rain tank three to four weeks to undergo complete curing.
								   Finally, we removed the interior support poles and dome sugar sacks and cleaned the
								   tank.</p>

								<h3><strong>VIP Latrines</strong></h3>
								<p><img class="img-responsive alignnone wp-image-139942 size-full"
								        src="https://res.cloudinary.com/the-water-project/image/upload/c_fill,dpr_auto,q_auto,f_auto,w_1200/WP-Uploads/community/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kenya21254-6-latrine-celebration.jpg"
								        alt=""><br>
									This project funded six new ventilated improved pit (VIP) latrines, three for the
									girls and three for the boys. These new latrines have cement floors designed to be
									easy to use and clean, locking doors for safety and privacy, and vents designed to
									keep air flowing up and out through the roof. With a rain tank right on school
									property, there should be enough water to keep them clean.</p>
								<h3><strong>New Knowledge</strong></h3>
								<p>We scheduled hygiene and sanitation training with the school's staff, who ensured
								   that the training date would be convenient for pupils and teachers. When the training
								   day arrived, the facilitators Betty, Stellar and Mercy deployed to the site to lead
								   the event.</p>
								<p>The Head Teacher had asked us to train the whole student population, but due to
								   COVID-19 restrictions, we trained a representative group instead. These students can
								   pass the knowledge on to their colleagues.</p>
								<p><img class="img-responsive alignnone wp-image-139929 size-full"
								        src="https://res.cloudinary.com/the-water-project/image/upload/c_fill,dpr_auto,q_auto,f_auto,w_1200/WP-Uploads/community/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Kenya21254-4-training-in-progress.jpg"
								        alt=""></p>
								<p>We focused on COVID-19 prevention, transmission, and symptoms while also covering
								   several other topics. These included personal hygiene such as bathing, oral hygiene,
								   and the ten steps of handwashing; environmental hygiene; child rights; operation and
								   maintenance of the rain tank, latrines, and handwashing stations; and leadership and
								   governance. During the latter, the students elected their peers to lead their newly
								   formed student health club.</p>
								<p>The club will be significantly involved in the water, sanitation, and hygiene project
								   management at school. It will encourage good health and hygiene practices amongst
								   their peers, teachers, and the larger community.</p>
								<p></p>

										alt="">
									<p class="wp-caption-text">Trying out handwashing techniques.</p></div>
								<p></p>
								<p>We involved stretches, dances, and physical activities between each topic to keep the
								   pupils' energy up and their minds active. By the end of the training, each pupil
								   understood their role in sustaining clean water and good health within their school
								   community.</p>

									The two handwashing stations were set up during training and handed over to the
									student health club. These were placed outside of the girls' and boys' latrines to
									encourage handwashing after latrine use. Health club members will teach other
									students how to wash their hands at the stations properly, make sure the stations
									are filled with water, and ensure that there is always a cleaning agent such as soap
									or ash available.</p>
								<p>Both girls and boys were shy when the facilitator brought out a sanitary towel.
								   However, after shedding more light on menstrual hygiene, the participants opened up
								   and asked a lot of questions.</p>

								<p>"Personally, I really appreciate our facilitators for coming to our poor school to
								   enlighten us on sanitation matters," said Laureen C., a 14-year-old pupil. "Most
								   girls fail to come to school during their monthly period because they fear being
								   laughed at by boys. But boys were asked not to laugh at us, but help us instead."</p>
								<p>"The training was valuable to me because there are some things that I never took
								   serious like...washing my hands, brushing my teeth, among others," said Hilary, a
								   13-year old student.</p>

								<p>"With this knowledge, I promise to put into practice what I have learned, and by so
								   doing I will always be clean."</p>
								<p>We asked Hilary what it was like to be at home for most of the last year due to
								   Kenya's national coronavirus-related school closures and what it has been like coming
								   back to school.</p>
								<p>"The pandemic really affected me," Hilary said. "I was prepared to sit for my final
								   exam last year, but that was not the case. One year was wasted at home."</p>
								<p>But the training filled Hilary with the resolve to apply what he learned. "As the
								   Chairperson of [the health] club, I will try my level best to ensure that pupils
								   observe all the rules and regulations put in place and even back at home. I will
								   ensure that we have soap at all times, be it at home or school."</p>
								<p>When an issue arises concerning the rain tank, the students and teachers are equipped
								   with the necessary skills to rectify the problem and ensure the water point works
								   appropriately. However, if the issue is beyond their capabilities, they can contact
								   our field officers to assist them. Also, we will continue to offer them unmatchable
								   support as a part of our ongoing monitoring and maintenance program.</p>

								                                        possible!</strong></h3>
